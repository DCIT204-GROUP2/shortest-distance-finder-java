<h1>UG Campus Route Finder</h1>
<p>The UG Campus Route Finder is a Java application designed to assist users in finding the best route from one location to another within the University of Ghana (UG) campus. The application utilizes the Dijkstra algorithm to determine the shortest distance and best arrival time between two locations on campus. Users can select their desired starting location (Location A) and destination (Location B) within the campus and obtain multiple route options, along with significant landmarks along each route.</p>
<h2>Features</h2>
<ul>
<li>Calculates the best route from Location A to Location B based on the shortest distance and best arrival time considering traffic conditions.</li>
<li>Utilizes various algorithms, including Dijkstra's algorithm, to determine the shortest path and distance.</li>
<li>Sorts the routes based on distance and arrival time, allowing the user to choose from the most suitable options.</li>
<li>Implements a searching algorithm that generates routes from a selected landmark to the destination, providing multiple route options.</li>
<li>Provides significant landmarks along each route to assist users in navigating through the campus.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Requirements</h2>
<ul>
<li>Java Development Kit (JDK) 8 or higher must be installed on the system.</li>
<li>Internet connectivity to access map data and calculate real-time distances.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Installation</h2>
<ol>
<li>Clone the project repository from GitHub using the following command:
<li>Open the project in your preferred Java development environment (e.g., IntelliJ, Eclipse, etc.).</li>
<li>Build the project to resolve dependencies and compile the source code.</li>
<li>Ensure that the system has an active internet connection to retrieve map data and calculate distances and traffic conditions.</li>
</ol>
<h2>Usage</h2>
<ol>
<li>Launch the UG Campus Route Finder application.</li>
<li>Enter the starting location (Location A) and destination (Location B) within the UG campus.</li>
<li>Select the desired algorithm (e.g., Dijkstra's algorithm) to calculate the best route efficiency.</li>
<li>The application will display multiple route options with their corresponding distances, arrival times, and significant landmarks.</li>
<li>If the user wants to search for routes from a landmark to the destination, enter the landmark name (e.g., "Bank").</li>
<li>The system will provide all routes associated with the landmark and the destination, along with significant landmarks for each route.</li>
<li>Choose the preferred route based on the displayed information.</li>
<li>Follow the provided route and landmarks to navigate through the UG campus efficiently.</li>
</ol>
<h2>Implementation Details</h2>
<p>The UG Campus Route Finder application is implemented using Java and incorporates various algorithms and techniques taught in class to ensure efficiency. One of the algorithms used is Dijkstra's algorithm, which calculates the shortest path and distance between nodes in the graph. The provided code snippet showcases the implementation of the Dijkstra class, which includes the core logic for finding the shortest path and distance using Dijkstra's algorithm.</p>
